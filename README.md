## Description

The Clean Architecture, popularized by [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), emphasizes several foundational principles:

1. **Framework Independence**: The system isn't reliant on external libraries or frameworks.
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be validated without any external elements.
3. **UI Independence**: Switching out the user interface won't affect the underlying system.
4. **Database Independence**: The system's business logic isn't tied to a specific database.
5. **Independence from External Agencies**: The business logic remains agnostic of external integrations.

### ‚ú® Additional Features and Patterns in This Project

This project not only adheres to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles but also incorporates modern adaptations and extended features to meet contemporary development needs:

- **GraphQL vs HTTP**:<br>The `entrypoints` module contains two API interfaces. `graphql` provides for a robust GraphQL API, while `http` focuses on RESTful API routes and controls.
- **RelationalDB vs NoSQL**:<br>The `repositories` module supports both relational and NoSQL databases. `relational_db` manages operations for databases like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, whereas `nosql` manages operations for NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CouchDB.

Apart from following Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture, this project also incorporates:

- **Repository Pattern**:<br>An abstraction that simplifies the decoupling of the model layer from data storage, thereby promoting flexibility and maintainability in the codebase. [^1]
- **Unit of Work Pattern**:<br>This pattern ensures that all operations within a single transaction are completed successfully, or none are completed at all. [^2]
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**:<br>Helps in reducing direct dependencies between codes, increasing the testability and flexibility of modules. [^3]
- **Asynchronous SQLalchemy**:<br>By utilizing the asynchronous capabilities of SQLAlchemy 2.0, database operations are optimized for performance and efficiently handle multitasking. [^4]
