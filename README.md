## project setup

### user setup
```
docker-compose up -d
```
### developer setup

1- I'm using [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) as package manager
```
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

2- install Dependencies
```
pdm install
```

3- add your secrets to .env file (not necessary)
```
echo "APP_URL=http://localhost:800" > .env
```

4- config modification (not necessary)
```
vim config/local.yml
```

5- setting up the infrustructure
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

6- run the consumer server
```
pdm consume 
```

7- run the apis server
```
pdm start
```

8- run the test
```bash
pdm test
```

## Endpoints
- `/docs/` : an online doc powered by swagger
- `/graphql/` : a graphql interface for similarity search
- `/knowledge_base/` : 
    - POST = add a knowledge base
    - DELETE = remove a knowledge base
- `/knowledge_base/{knowledge_base_name}/document` : 
    - POST = add a document to a knowledge base
    - DELETE = remove a document from a knowledge base
- `/knowledge_base/{knowledge_base_name}/document/?q={your_query}` : 
    - GET = get the documents that have similar content based on your query

## System Design
As you can see in the picture below, this is our system design.

### User Interaction:

The user interacts with an HTTP server. The server utilizes Redis as the database, resulting in fast service.

### Handling Faiss and ML Model:

You might be wondering about the handling of Faiss and ML model, which can be slower. We have cleverly hidden that complexity. Here's how it works:

1. Message Broker Integration:
   - Whenever a user interacts with Redis, if there is a need for anything Faiss-related, we simultaneously send a message to the message broker while querying Redis.

2. Background Consumer:
   - All the slow processes related to Faiss and the ML model are handled in the background consumer.

### Redis as Database and Message Broker:

Since we already have Redis as the database, we have leveraged it as the message broker as well. This design allows us to streamline the system, maximize efficiency, and maintain a cohesive architecture.

## Changelog

- **v1**: <br> March 2024. <br>**Description**: Initial proposal by me.


## Architecture

The Clean Architecture, popularized by [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), emphasizes several foundational principles:

1. **Framework Independence**: The system isn't reliant on external libraries or frameworks.
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be validated without any external elements.
3. **UI Independence**: Switching out the user interface won't affect the underlying system.
4. **Database Independence**: The system's business logic isn't tied to a specific database.
5. **Independence from External Agencies**: The business logic remains agnostic of external integrations.

### âœ¨ Additional Features and Patterns in This Project

This project not only adheres to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles but also incorporates modern adaptations and extended features to meet contemporary development needs:

- **GraphQL vs HTTP**:<br>The `entrypoints` module contains two API interfaces. `graphql` provides for a robust GraphQL API, while `restapi` focuses on RESTful API routes and controls.
- **Faiss vs Redis**:<br>The `repositories` module supports both Redis and Faiss databases. `adapters/faisss_db` manages operations for Faiss, whereas `adapters/redis_db` manages operations for redis.

Apart from following Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture, this project also incorporates:

- **Repository Pattern**:<br>An abstraction that simplifies the decoupling of the model layer from data storage, thereby promoting flexibility and maintainability in the codebase. [^1]
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**:<br>Helps in reducing direct dependencies between codes, increasing the testability and flexibility of modules. [^3]
- **Asynchronous Capabilities**:<br>By utilizing the asynchronous capabilities of Faiss and Redis, database operations are optimized for performance and efficiently handle multitasking. [^4]

### ðŸ§± Project Structure Overview & Clean Architecture Mapping

Based on Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles, this project's structure and architecture flow diagrams are aligned with these principles.

#### Directory Structure
